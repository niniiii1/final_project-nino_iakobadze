          Hey everyone! ðŸŒŸ I just wrapped up the HTML and CSS crash courses by
          TBC and Geolab, and I couldnâ€™t be more excited to share this little
          milestone! A few weeks ago, I barely knew what HTML and CSS stood for.
          Today, Iâ€™ve built my very first web page, styled it with CSS, and even
          started understanding how the web works behind the scenes. It wasnâ€™t
          always easyâ€”there were moments of frustration (hello, broken layouts
          and missing tags!)â€”but every challenge taught me something new. These
          courses werenâ€™t just about learning to code. They showed me that tech
          isnâ€™t some mysterious world I donâ€™t belong in. Itâ€™s a space I can be a
          part of, grow in, and even thrive in. ðŸ’ª A huge thank you to the teams
          at TBC and Geolab for making coding approachable, practical, and fun.
          This is just the beginningâ€”next up, Iâ€™m diving into JavaScript, and
          who knows where that will take me? If youâ€™re thinking about learning
          to code but feel unsure, take the leap. Start small, stay curious, and
          donâ€™t be afraid to break things. Thatâ€™s how we learn. Until next time,
          Nini ðŸ’»âœ¨
